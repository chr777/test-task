# What is it?
We prepared this minimal boilerplate, so you can start implementing the designs with all the required configs for code style and Next.js environment. 

Fork this repo and send us a link to the repo with your results.

**Figma Designs:** https://www.figma.com/file/SWyCwoO9gHgwsAMMNtwzWW/Test-Task?node-id=0%3A1

## Task
 - Implement "Add Customer"/"Edit Customer" functionality 
 - Implement "Delete Customer" button

## Requirements

 - Use Redux as state mangement tool
 - Use [jdenticon](https://github.com/dmester/jdenticon) to generate avatars (email as input)
 - Use Tailwind for styling
 - will be a plus if you use https://miragejs.com  tools to create api-s and use them in application
 - if you are not using mirageJS please use Redux Persist to store data in localstorage
 - Show us best practices you know 

## Anything else?
If you think that there are not enough details in some part of the task, just implement it the way you think it should be.

Be careful! We expect you to extract as much information from the designs as possible.
